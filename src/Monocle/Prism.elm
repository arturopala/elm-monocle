{-| A Prism is a tool which optionally converts elements of type A into elements of type B and back.


# Definition

@docs Prism


# Example

    string2IntPrism : Prism String Int
    string2IntPrism =
        Prism String.toInt String.fromInt

    string2IntPrism.getOption "17896" == Just 17896
    string2IntPrism.getOption "1a896" == Nothing
    string2IntPrism.reverseGet 1626767 = "1626767"
